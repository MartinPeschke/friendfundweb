Hi ${data['invitee_name']}, 

I have created a secret friendfund pool for ${data['pool_title']} and would like to invite you to contribute too!  

${data['message']}    

We have until the ${data['expiry_date']} to make this happen!  Chip in as little or a much as you like (even the smallest contribution helps)!  

You can log in to the [pool page](http://${data['merchant_domain']}/pool/${data['p_url']}) with ${data['login_email']} and this password ${data['pwd']}. 
Please change your password to something that you will remember in Settings > Password.   
  
Sshhhh! Remember this is a suprise, so be careful how you share.  

Thank you
