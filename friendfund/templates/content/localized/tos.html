<p class="general">Terms of Service<br/>("ToS")<br/>Effective as of 2011/03/15</p>

<p class="general">friendfund GmbH (hereinafter "friendfund") operates a social network on the internet which helps the users of the network to give presents to friends by setting up a Gift Pool on friendfund.com and thereby collecting the money needed for a certain gift or for a gift voucher. friendfund cooperates with a broad range of providers of goods and services ("Merchants") at whose online shops the gifts can be selected by the initiator of a Gift Pool, the “Pool Admin”. Any User who is registered with friendfund can contribute to an active Gift Pool ("Contributor") by donating an amount of money at his/her discretion. Once the Contributors have collected a sufficient amount of money to buy the gift that they have decided on, the Pool Admin will receive an email from friendfund in which he is informed that the money has been transferred to the PayPal account named by him or which will contain the code for the gift voucher that he decided upon. He is then able to arrange the shipping of the gift in question to the recipient of the gift or to send to him the code for the gift voucher.</p>

<h6 class="noBg">1 General Provisions</h6>

<p class="general noPad">The use of the services offered on the friendfund website by the friendfund GmbH, Landsberger Allee 117, 10407 Berlin, Germany are exclusively subject to these Terms of Service ("ToS").</p>

<h6 class="noBg">2 Conclusion of the Agreement</h6>

<p class="general noPad">2.1 To participate in friendfund the User of the friendfund website (“User”) needs to register at the website or connect via another social network with friendfund. The registration is free for all Users. </p>

<p class="general">2.2 Only private individuals are entitled to register with friendfund. In order to contribute to a Gift Pool, the User needs to be of legal age because this will require access to means of payment such as PayPal or credit cards. friendfund reserves the right to verify the personal data of a User. An account with friendfund is not transferable.</p>

<p class="general">2.3 To register with friendfund, Users need to accept these Terms of Service.</p>

<p class="general">2.4 Once friendfund accepts the User’s registration, he will receive a confirmation email. friendfund reserves the right to refuse a registration without providing any reasons. In this case all data that has been transmitted by the User will be deleted.</p>

<p class="general">2.5 Once the registration is complete, the User can benefit from the services of friendfund, such as setting up gift pools, and contributing to existing gift pools.</p>

<h6 class="noBg">3 Setting up a Gift Pool</h6>

<p class="general noPad">3.1 The User sets up a Gift Pool on the friendfund website by first entering the sum of money he wants to raise as well as setting up a deadline until the end of which he wishes to receive contributions to the Gift Pool. After this he can define what kind of present he wants to make and what the occasion for the gift is by entering a title and a short description for the Gift Pool. It is also possible to describe the gift by entering a link to a third party website. Neither the description of the gift nor any pictures used for the description of the gift must violate the rights of third parties and must only be used with regard to a description of the present in question. </p>

<p class="general">In addition to this, the Pool Admin can choose whether he wants to receive a gift voucher for the amount of money he intends to raise or whether he prefers the money to be transferred to a PayPal account named by him. After having entered all the necessary details for the Gift Pool, the Pool Admin may invite others through other social networks or via email to take part in the Pool. As long as a Gift Pool is “active” all Users that have been invited may themselves invite others to become Contributors to the Pool. The Pool Admin is free to contribute to his Gift Pool; however, such a contribution is not mandatory for the process of setting up a Gift Pool.</p>

<p class="general">3.2 As soon as the amount of money that was stated by the Pool Admin has been collected by the Contributors of the Gift Pool, friendfund will either forward to the Pool Admin the code for the chosen gift voucher or will transfer the money to his PayPal account. If the Pool Admin chooses the option of having the money raised transferred to his PayPal account, he will be required to pay friendfund a transaction fee equaling 1 per cent of the sum of money in the account. If he chooses the option of acquiring a gift voucher friendfund will not ask for a transaction fee. </p>

<p class="general">3.3 The Gift Pool will be active for an initial period after the activation ("Initial Period"). In case the Contributors failed to collect a sufficient amount of money after the Initial Period during which the Pool was active, the Pool Admin can extend the duration of the Gift Pool for another fixed period of time ("Extended Period") by sending reminders to the actual Contributors. He also can solicit new Contributors via the friendfund network. The Pool Admin cannot cancel or shut down an Active Gift pool prematurely.</p>

<p class="general">3.4 In case the purchase price has not been met after either in the Initial or the Extended Period all contributions made by participants in the Pool through the use of PayPay will automatically be refunded and the credit cards of those Contributors who used credit cards to donate money will not be charged. </p>

<p class="general">3.5 Friendfund reveres the right to allow for the creation of Gift Pools for wich the procedure laid down at para. 3.4 of these ToS is not applicable and for which there will be no refund of money paid using PayPal and for which credit cards that have been used for contributions to the Pool will be charged even if the amount of money that has been asked for by the Pool Admin was not raised within the periode of time stipulated by him. If the procedure laid down at papa. 3.4 of these ToS is not applicable for a Gift Pool friendfund will point this out to the possible Contributors before they make their contributions. </p>

<p class="general">3.6 It is the responsibility of the Pool Admin to use the money raised on the friendsfund website for the specific purpose he laid down in the desciption of the Gift Pool. The Pool Admin acknowledges that when using the money that was collected through the use of the services of friendsfund to buy the intended present, he will become the contractual party of the respective Merchant and that he will need to execute any warranty claims, rights of withdrawal, liability claims, exchange requests, customer service inquiries only towards the respective Merchant. The Pool Admin acknowledges that he is not entitled to execute any of the aforementioned rights towards friendfund. By setting up a Gift Pool the Pool Admin guarantees that he has read, understood and accepts the Terms of Services of the respective Merchant.</p>

<h6 class="noBg">4 Contributing to a Gift Pool</h6>

<p class="general  noPad">4.1 A User who decides to become a Contributor can contribute directly to an Active Gift Pool either if he was invited by the Pool Admin for a specific Gift Pool or by browsing in his friends list for Active Gift Pools and participating in one of these Pools without first having been invited.</p>

<p class="general">4.2 Once the Contributor has selected an Active Gift Pool he can choose the amount of his contribution, select a payment option and finalize his donation. Once the payment process is completed, the donated amount will be credited to the respective Gift Pool.</p>

<p class="general">4.3 In case the sum of money that was envisaged by the Pool Admin was not collected within the time frame set by him, contributions will be refunded in accordance with the procedure laid down at para. 3.4 of these ToS. If for any Pool refunds are not possible in the case that a specific amount of money was not raised in time friendfund will point this out to the User in accordance with para. 3.5 of these ToS</p>

<p class="general">4.4 Purchase prices, VAT and shipping costs for a present selected by the Pool Admin which does not consist out of a gift voucher may vary from time to time and are beyond the responsibility of friendfund.</p>

<p class="general">4.5 The Contributor acknowledges that – depending upon the option chosen by the Pool Admin when he created the Gift Pool - the money that has been donated for the Gift Pool will either be transferred to a PayPal account named by the Pool Admin or will be transferred by friendfund to a Merchant that will issue the selected gift voucher. In case the Pool Admin settled for the option of receiving a gift voucher the code for the respective voucher will be sent to the Pool Admin. </p>

<p class="general">The Pool Admin will be the proprietor of the credit transferred to his PayPal account or the receiver of the code for the gift voucher respectively. </p>

<p class="general">4.6 Friendfund will generally not check the legality, accuracy or completeness of any of the Gift Pools created on the friendfund website. Friendfund will also not check whether the money raised or a gift voucher bought is used in accordance with the purpose given by the Pool Admin when creating the Gift Pool. Therefore it is the responsibility of each User to look into the identity of the Pool Admin and to direct any complaints with regard to the use of the money raised or the issued gift voucher to the Pool Admin himself. </p>

<h6 class="noBg">5 Completing a Gift Pool</h6>

<p class="general  noPad">5.1 Once the Contributors have raised sufficient money for the purchase of the gift that has been picked by the Pool Admin, the Pool Admin completes the Gift Pool by clicking on the complete button in the area for registered members.
