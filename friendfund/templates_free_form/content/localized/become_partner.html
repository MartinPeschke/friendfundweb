<p class="general">We are looking for partnerships with fun and fresh online retailers.  </p>

<p class="general">Do you sell something that groups of friends would want to buy for their mate or co-worker?  
Adding a “friendfund it!” tab to your site, your customers can create a friendfund pool to purchase the product, invite their friends and chip in!  Check out how it works here <a href="http://www.caseable.com/gallery.php">www.caseable.com</a>.</p>
<br/>

<p class="general">Some great advantages to a “friendfund it!” white-label solution on your site.</p>

<p class="general"><span class="bold">Increase the visibility of your brand and products on Facebook and Twitter.</span> For every pool created through the “friendfund it!’ tab, a facebook event, wall posts and tweets are generated.  As more friends join the pool and spread the word, more genuine conversations between friends around your products are created.</p>

<p class="general"><span class="bold">Open your products to affordable buyer solutions.</span> Generate new sales with groups of friends who now have a simple and fun way to chip in to the cost of a group gift.</p>

<p class="general"><span class="bold">Social network driven market research.  </span> Once friendfund has been integrated into your website, we will send you regular analyltics of which products are sellings. </p>
