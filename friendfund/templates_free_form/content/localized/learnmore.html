	<div class="subHeading"></div>
			

	<p class="general">friendfund it! Financial collaboration empowering communities of friends.</p>

	<p class="general">friendfund is a simple way for communities of friends to collect money for anything they like.  Using the social network infrastructure of Facebook and Twitter, friendfund connects you to the people you already know to create dynamic social funding solutions. You can friendfund a group gift, purchase equipment for your local club, organise a group holiday or use it for any kind of group payment. Your imagination is the only limit!</p>
	
	<p class="general">A friendfund can be created at friendfund.com to collect money via Paypal or as Amazon Vouchers. Or for purchasing goods with our Merchant Partners using the handy “friendfund it!” button.</p>

	<p class="general bold">Still not sure what you could use friendfund for?</p>
	<p class="general">Edward and his friends want to get some new equipment for their soccer club. They have just what they need on amazon.com, so they decide to friendfund it.</p>

	<p class="general">Martina is part of an artist collective based on a large boat.  This summer they want to get the engines running to do some projects offshore. They set up a friendfund to pay for the tugboat.</p>

	<p class="general">Amanda finds the perfect gift (flying lessons!) for her friend Megan on Great American Days, she creates a friendfund and invites their mutual friends to chip in.  Even their friends who live out of town can still be a part of the celebration.</p>
