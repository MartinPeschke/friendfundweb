	<h4>Company</h4>
	<div class="subHeading"></div>

	<p class="general">friendfund was founded July 2010 with the aim of building a platform which synthesises the internet’s most progressive aspects, the social web and ecommerce.</p>
	<p class="general">Our goal is to provide the online community with the financial tools which harness the power of the social web in a fun and simple way.  </p>
	<p class="general">Initially focusing on group gifting, the friendfund beta was released in October 2010 and with the invaluable feedback from our members, an upgraded site was released March 2011. Now the friendfund platform has opened up the group gifting model to allow groups of friends collect money for anything at all.</p>
	<p class="general">Also improved is the sharing experience of a friendfund pool with widgets that can be used on your website or blog and the creation of merchant white label integration with our partners amazon, donanda, Great American Days and caseable.</p>
