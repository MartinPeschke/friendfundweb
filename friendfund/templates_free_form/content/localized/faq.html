		<h4>The Basics</h4>
				<div class="subHeading"></div>
					<h5><a name="faq01">What is friendfund?</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>
					<p>friendfund is a flexible social commerce platform that can be used for just about anything that needs a simple way for a group of friends to collect money.</p>
					<h5><a name="faq02">Why have I received a friendfund pool invitation?</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>
					<p>A friend has created a pool and invited you to chip in. Click on the Pools tab and you should see your friend's Pool in the “My Pools” section.</p>

		<h4>Creating a Pool</h4>
		<div class="subHeading"></div>
					<h5><a name="faq03">What is “All or Nothing”?</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>
					<p>As the name suggests, for the Pool to be successful it needs to reach its target before the expiry date.  Why?  It is transparent: tell your friends what the Pool is for, they like the idea and contribute.  Their contribution is only then used if the Pool gets enough support for that idea. It is also great motivation for the contributors to help you promote the Pool and make it happen!</p>
					<h5><a name="faq04">Why is the limit set to 10 days?</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>
					<p>Keeping it short and sweet, means you see the result faster. It also creates some urgency so you can keep the momentum of your Pool going. </p>
					<h5><a name="faq05">What happens if we don’t raise enough money before the Pool closes?</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>
					<p>friendfund pool credit card contributions are only debited when the Pool reaches its target and any contributions made with PayPal are refunded.
		There are lots of tools to send out reminders and share the Pool - so you shouldn’t have any problems drumming up the support for your Pool!</p>
					<h5><a name="faq06">Can I get something for myself?</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>
					<p>Yes. When using friendfund with one of our merchants simply select the recipient as yourself.</p>
		<h4>Inviting Friends</h4>
		<div class="subHeading"></div>	
					<h5><a name="faq07">Why am I receiving messages from friendfund Pools?</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>	
					<p>friendfund is designed as a fun and social way for groups of friends to collect money. Pool messages help get everyone involved and excited about chipping and most importantly reaching the target! If you are not interested in 
receiving messages from the Pools you have been invited to, go to “Settings” in the drop down menu under your profile 
name (top right) and select the “Notifications” tab. You will find all the settings you need here. </p>
					<h5><a name="faq08">I want my friends to opt into a Pool rather than being added through the invitation process.</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>	
					<p>Share the link with your friends and when they visit the Pool page they can click on the ‘Join Pool’ button. </p>
		<h4>Chipping in</h4>
		<div class="subHeading"></div>
					<h5><a name="faq09">Can I Chip In with another currency?</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>
					<p>You can chip in to any pool, no matter the currency.  Chip in with the currency stated on the pool and your Paypal or Credit Card provider will exchange your chip in amount to your local currency.  More information about exchanges rates can be found here: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/helpcenter/main.jsp?cmd=_help&solutio
nId=163394&t=solutionTab&bn_r=o">PayPal</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://usa.visa.com/personal/using_visa/exchange_rates_faq.html">Visa</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mastercard.us/support/currency-conversion.html"> Mastercard</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://corp.americanexpress.com/gcs/travel/us/corp/sbt/resources/currency.aspx"> American Express</a></p>
					<h5><a name="faq10">Can I get a refund or return the gift?</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>
					<p>If, for any reason, the recipient is unhappy with their gift then the pool admin can return the product directly to the merchant and receive refund or an alternative product directly from them subject to the merchant's returns and refund policy.</p>
					<h5><a name="faq11">What fees will I be charged?</a><a href="#" class="linkTop">Top</a></h5>
					<p>As a contributor, you are not charged any transaction fees.
When you create a Pool, you have the choice of receiving your funds as either a Merchant Voucher (free) or via 
PayPal.
<br><br>
Receiving payment via PayPal we charge a 1% fee to cover the transaction costs of your contributors. PayPal may 
also charge you a receiving fee. This amount varies depending on the type of PayPal account you have and where you 
are located. Please check with PayPal in your region for more details. </p>
