		<h4>What is friendfund?</h4>
		<div class="subHeading"></div>
		<p class="general">We founded  friendfund in July 2010 with  the aim of building an open platform which synthesises the internet’s most progressive aspects, namely  the social web  and ecommerce.</p>
<p class="general">The emergence of universal online social networks such as facebook, coupled with the explosion in ecommerce, urges the creation of a paradigm shifting social commerce platform.</p>
<p class="general">Our goal is to provide the online community with open tools with global reach which harness the power of the social web and put it to work for a very wide range of organisations from local non-profit groups to the largest online retailers.</p>
<p class="general">The technology will project users into dynamic financial associations with their friends and facilitate social fund raising and group payment.</p>
<p class="general">Our  innovative financial applications will escort retailers into the heart of the internet’s social communities where every exposure  generates invaluable social currency.</p>
<p class="general">Social commerce is still in its infancy and we have taken the opportunity to  maximize its potential and play a role in its unification of online commerce and collaboration.</p>

			<p>Harry was the founder and director of several successful social entrepreneurship projects.
The creation of these enterprises was greatly hindered by the lack of a flexible and convenient way for members to pool their resources.
He co-founded friendfund to solve this problem by providing tools to clubs, communities and friends which facilitate dynamic financial collaborations.
He has ten years experience  as an IT Consultant leading projects in a wide variety of organizations including Web start-ups and investment banks.
Harry received his BA from Middlesex University, London and MA in Philosophy from the University of Sussex.</p>
