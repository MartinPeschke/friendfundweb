Hi ${data['contributor_name']},  

Congratulations, we collected ${data['contribution_amount']} for ${data['pool_title']}.  

Unfortunately time is up, our friendfund pool has expired without reaching the target of ${data['target_amount']}.   

As our pool was “All or Nothing” no payments have been processed.   

Check out all the messages and contributions: <http://${data['merchant_domain']}/pool/${data['p_url']}>  
Better luck next time!  

All the best
