<li>Will my gift receiver find out about the present?
<p> On the invite page there is a box you can tick which will make the pool secret. This means any notifications sent to social network news feeds will not mention the product or your friends name.</p></li>

<li>What happens if we don’t raise enough money before the pool closes?
<p> Don’t worry. The pool admin has the chance to extend the pool and send out more invite reminders. He can even ask the gift recipient if they would like to make up the difference themselves. If all else fails he can select a new product which there is enough funds for or if they prefer they can send the recipient a gift voucher instead.</p></li>

<li>Why do you have transaction costs?
<p> We offer our service completely free. All we ask if that contributors cover the transaction costs we have to pay to our payment provider.</p></li>

<li>Can I get a refund or return the gift?
<p> If for any reason the recipient is unhappy with the product then the pool admin can return the product directly to the merchant and receive refund or an alternative product directly from them subject to the merchants returns and refund policy.</p></li>


<li>Can I get something for myself?
<p> Yes. When selecting receiver in the friend panel just click “yourself”.</p></li>

<li>What happens if I get an ‘experience’?
<p> We also sell tickets for experiences such balloon rides or concerts. Tickets will be posted to your recipient.</p></li>

<li>How do I change my password.
<p> Click on the profile tab at the top. Then in the email section you can enter a new password.</p></li>

<li>Why have  I received a friendfund pool invite.
<p> A friend has created a gift pool and invited you to chip in. Click on the pools tab and you should see your friends pool in the my pools section.</p></li>

<li>My confirmation email doesn’t arrive.
<p> Please check your spam filter or request a new confirmation email.</p></li>

<li>Why do I have multiple accounts on the profile page.
<p> Friendfund has an innovative way to allow you to combine your friend lists from different social networks. You can set which network credentials you would like to use as your default on the profile page. We will then always display this networks profile picture and name.</p></li>

<li>I am connected with facebook but see my twitter profile picture and name.
<p> This is because you have set twitter to be your default network in the profile page. 
You can change this by clicking on the profile tab and setting facebook to be your default profile.</p></li>

<li>When connecting with my facebook or twitter account I receive a message saying that the account is already taken. Why is this?
<p> This is because the particular network profile is already associated with another user. If you wish to use that account you must log out of friendfund and log in with that networks connect button and account.</p></li>
