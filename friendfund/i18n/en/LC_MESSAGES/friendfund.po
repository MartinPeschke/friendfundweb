"Pool</p><p><span>3.1</span>In order to set up an Active Gift Pool and to "
"become a Pool Admin, the User can browse the goods and services of the "
"Merchants that are listed at friendfund. Once he selects a certain gift, "
"he can activate a Gift Pool for this very gift. The Pool Admin enters his"
" and the Receiver’s address in order to be provided to the Merchant for "
"the purchase of the gift by friendfund on behalf of the Pool Admin. The "
"Pool Admin will become contractual party of the respective Merchant. In "
"case the sufficient amount of money has been raised in order to buy a "
"specific gift, friendfund will submit both the Pool Admin’s and the "
"Reciever’s address to the Merchant and place the respective order at the "
"Merchant’s online-shop. While the Gift Pool is active, the Pool Admin can"
" invite other Users to donate to the Active Gift Pool and become a "
"Contributor. The Pool Admin is free to contribute to his Gift Pool; his "
"contribution is not mandatory.</p><p><span>3.2</span>The Gift Pool will "
"be active for an initial period after the activation (\"Initial "
"Period\"). In case the Contributors did not collect a sufficient amount "
"of money in order to meet the respective purchase price of the gift, the "
"Pool Admin can extend the duration of the Gift Pool for another period  "
"(\"Extended Period\") by sending reminders to the actual Contributors. He"
" also can solicit new Contributors via the friendfund network. The Pool "
"Admin cannot cancel or shut down an Active Gift pool "
"prematurely.</p><p><span>3.3</span>In case the purchase price of the gift"
" has neither been met in the Initial Period - and the Pool Admin decided "
"not to send reminders to the Contributors - nor in the Extended Period, "
"the Pool Admin needs to close the Gift Pool by choosing to purchase a "
"gift voucher and issue this gift voucher to the Receiver in lieu of the "
"gift. The value of the gift voucher will be the equivalent of the money "
"that has been raised so far by the Contributors.</p><p><span>3.4</span>In"
" case the purchase price has not been met in either Period and the Pool "
"Admin does not close the Pool by requesting a gift voucher, the Gift Pool"
" will become dormant within thirty (30) days after the elapse of either "
"the Initial or Extended Period. The Pool Admin will be issued a reminder "
"via email in order to close the Gift Pool by requesting a gift "
"voucher.</p><p><span>3.5</span>After the elapse 3 years, beginning with "
"the last day of that year in which the Gift Pool has become dormant, the "
"credit will become time-barred and therefore "
"forfeited.</p><p><span>3.6</span>In case the purchase price has been met "
"either in the Initial or Extended Period, the Pool Admin completes the "
"Gift Pool by proceeding to the purchase process. See paragraph 5 – "
"Completing a Gift Pool.</p><p><span>3.7</span>The Pool Admin acknowledges"
" that he will become contractual party of the respective Merchant and "
"that he will need to execute any warranty claims, rights of withdrawal, "
"liability claims, exchange requests, customer service inquiries only "
"towards the respective Merchant. The Pool Admin acknowledges that he is "
"not entitled to execute any of the aforementioned rights towards "
"friendfund. By setting up a Gift Pool the Pool Admin guarantees that he "
"has read, understood and accepts the Terms of Services of the respective "
"Merchant.</p><p class=\"tosmainsection\"><span>4</span>Contributing to a "
"Gift Pool</p><p><span>4.1</span>The User who decides to become a "

"by the Pool Admin for a specific Gift Pool or browsing in their friends "
"list for Active Gift Pools.</p><p><span>4.2</span>Once the Contributor "
"has selected an Active Gift Pool he can choose the amount of his "
"contribution, select a payment option and finalize his donation. Once the"
" payment process is completed, the donated amount will be credited to the"
" respective Gift Pool.</p><p><span>4.3</span>Contributions are final and "
"cannot be reclaimed and will not be reimbursed for any reason "
"whatsoever.</p><p><span>4.4</span>The Contributor acknowledges that he "

"price. Purchase prices, VAT and shipping costs may vary from time to time"
" and are beyond the responsibility of "
"friendfund.</p><p><span>4.5</span>The Contributor acknowledges that the "
"money that has been donated for a Gift Pool will be transferred to an "
"account of friendfund and will be managed by the Pool Admin in terms of "
"either purchasing the chosen gift in case the price has been met or "
"purchasing gift vouchers when the price has not been met. The Pool Admin "
"will not be at any time the proprietor of the credit, he has the sole "
"function of handling the donations as a trustee (fiduciary) in terms of "
"either purchasing the selected gift or purchase gift vouchers of equal "
"monetary value.</p><p><span>4.6</span>In case the Contributor raises more"
" money than required for a specific gift, the excess will be cashed out "
"in gift vouchers.</p><p><span>4.7</span>The Contributor acknowledges that"

"money for the purchase of the gift that has been picked by the Pool "
"Admin, the Pool Admin completes the Gift Pool by clicking on the complete"
" button in the area for registered members. By completing the Gift Pool, "
"the address of the Pool Admin will be transmitted to the Merchant by "
"friendfund in order to provide the Merchant with contact data and the "
"billing address since the purchase contract will be brokered by "
"friendfund and concluded between the Pool Admin and the respective "
"Merchant. friendfund will as well transmit the address of the Receiver to"
" the Merchant in order to provide him with the required shipping "
"address.</p><p><span>5.2</span>After the completion of the Gift Pool, the"
" raised money will be transferred from friendfund to the Merchant in "
"order to pay for the purchased gift. Once the gift is ordered and the "
"purchase price has been transmitted to the Merchant, the Gift Pool will "
"become completed and inactive. The Pool Admin and the Contributors will "
"be able to review the Completed Gift Pool for the sole purpose of "
"information for a period of thirty (30) days after completion. After this"
" period, the Gift Pool may become inaccessible to the "
"Users.</p><p><span>5.3</span>In case the specified gift becomes "
"unavailable after setting up a Gift Pool, upon completion the Pool Admin "
"can pick another gift or choose a gift voucher that is equivalent in "
"price.</p><p><span>5.4</span>In case the purchase price of a specified "
"gift will decline after the activation of a Gift Pool, the money in "
"excess of the original price will be cashed out to the Receiver in form "
"of a gift voucher of that very Merchant. In case the purchase price of a "
"specified gift will rise after the activation of a Gift Pool, the Gift "
"Pool can either be completed by donating more money by the Contributors "
"or can be closed according to paragraph 3.3.</p><p "
